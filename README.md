The Student Management System SQL project is a mini database application designed to manage key academic operations such as storing student information, managing courses, assigning instructors, and handling student enrollments. The project includes multiple interrelated tables such as Students, Courses, Instructors, Enrollments, and EnrollmentLogs. It demonstrates core database concepts including table creation, relationships through foreign keys, and data integrity. To enhance functionality, a stored procedure named EnrollStudent is used to simplify the student enrollment process. A SQL view called StudentCoursePerformance is created to display a consolidated report of student performance, including course names and instructors. The system also incorporates an AFTER INSERT trigger named LogEnrollmentChange, which automatically logs enrollment activity into a separate table for tracking purposes. This project is an excellent demonstration of database normalization, structured query language (SQL) usage, and real-world data handling in an educational environment.
